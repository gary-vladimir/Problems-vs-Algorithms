## Autocomplete with Tries

### Design

1. Trie Node

    - Insert Operation
    - Suffixes Operation

2. Trie
    - Insert Operation
    - Find Operation

## Run-time Analysis

The time complexity for insert and find: `O(n)` and for suffixes: `O(n*m)`

The space complexity for insert: `O(n)` and for suffixes:`O(n*m)`
