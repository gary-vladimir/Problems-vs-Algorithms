## HTTPRouter using a Trie

> For this exercise we are going to implement an HTTPRouter like you would find in a typical web server using the Trie data structure we learned previously.

### Design

1. Router class
2. RouteTrie class
    - Insert
    - Find
3. RouteTrieNode class
    - insert

## Run-time Analysis

The time complexity for `insert` is: `O(n)` and for `find` is: `O(n)`

The space complexity for both it's also: `O(n)`
